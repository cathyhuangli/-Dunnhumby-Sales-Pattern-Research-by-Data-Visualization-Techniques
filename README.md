# Dunnhumby Sales Pattern Research using Data Visualization Techniques
Grocery retailers employ a wide variety of marketing techniques, such as in-store displays, coupons, and weekly sales mailers. To succeed, it’s essential that store management understand their customers, their needs and behaviors, and the role that marketing techniques play in supporting sales. Our group sought to better understand these relationships through a variety of visualization techniques. Data science company Dunnhumby released a dataset called “The Complete Journey” that provided the data for our exploration. “The Complete Journey” provides a comprehensive look at grocery sales and marketing over a 2-year period. The data includes item-level detail for more than 276,484 transactions, as well as data on marketing efforts during the time period, detailed specifications on the 92,260 products available for sale, and demographic data for 2,500 customers. 

Specifically, our group asked four questions: 

● What sales patterns are evident over time? 

● How are coupons offers utilized in marketing products? 

● Which products do customers tend to purchase together? 

● How product’s display location in a store could affect sales?

Here is one display of our visualization of sales pattern:
